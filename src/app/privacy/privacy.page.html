      <h3>1.3 Data Retention Period</h3>
      <p>The retention of personal data depends on the applicable legal retention periods. Once these periods expire, the relevant data will be deleted, provided that the data is no longer required for fulfilling contracts, initiating contracts, or other purposes.</p>

      <h3>1.4 Data Transfers to Third Countries</h3>
      <p>If we process or transmit data to entities located outside the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), this is done only when necessary for contractual obligations, with your consent, due to legal obligations, or based on legitimate interests. Such transfers occur under strict compliance with GDPR Articles 44-49, ensuring equivalent data protection through mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).</p>
